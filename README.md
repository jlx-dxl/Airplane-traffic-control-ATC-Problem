The Airplane Traffic Control (ATC) project aims to develop a strategy for managing airplane navigation in a simulated environment. The primary goal is to ensure all planes reach their destinations as quickly as possible while avoiding collisions and minimizing delays and power consumption. Each plane's journey is defined by its origin and destination coordinates, and its departure time, specified in a configuration file. The simulation operates in a 2D Cartesian space where planes can only move horizontally and vertically, adhering to specific movement constraints to avoid collisions.

The ATC strategy implemented in this project utilizes a combination of **direct path planning**, **simulated annealing**, and **randomized adjustments** to optimize the planes' flight paths and departure times. Initially, each plane is assigned a direct path from its origin to its destination, with corresponding bearings calculated to guide the plane along this path. The bearing adjustments are constrained to a maximum of Â±10 degrees per time step, ensuring smooth transitions and adherence to the movement rules.

A key aspect of the implementation is the use of **simulated annealing**, a probabilistic optimization technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. This technique allows the algorithm to explore a wide range of potential solutions, gradually refining them to minimize the overall cost. The cost function considers three main factors: time cost (the duration until all planes reach their destinations), power cost (the total flight time of all planes), and delay cost (the time planes spend on the ground after their scheduled departure time). Additionally, a collision penalty is included to enforce the requirement that no two planes come within 5 units of each other.

The **simulated annealing** process begins with a high temperature, allowing the algorithm to accept suboptimal solutions with a higher probability. This enables extensive exploration of the solution space, preventing the algorithm from getting trapped in local optima. As the temperature decreases, the algorithm becomes more selective, accepting only improvements or slight degradations in the cost function. This gradual cooling process leads to convergence on a near-optimal solution.

To further enhance the optimization process, **random delays** and **path bending** are introduced. **Randomly delaying the departure times** of planes helps explore different scheduling configurations, while **path bending** adjusts the straight-line paths to slightly curved ones, using **quadratic Bezier curves**. This approach provides more flexibility in avoiding potential collisions and optimizing the overall flight paths.

The cost calculation involves summing the time, power, and delay costs for all planes, with additional penalties for any instances where planes come too close to each other. The algorithm iteratively updates the flight paths and departure times, continually evaluating and refining the solutions based on the calculated cost. The final result is a set of optimized flight paths that minimize travel time, power consumption, and delays while ensuring safe separation between all planes.

The implementation demonstrates a sophisticated approach to ATC, balancing multiple objectives and constraints to achieve efficient and safe airplane navigation. The combination of **direct path planning**, **simulated annealing**, and **random adjustments** provides a robust framework for optimizing complex flight schedules, making this project a valuable contribution to the field of air traffic control simulation.
